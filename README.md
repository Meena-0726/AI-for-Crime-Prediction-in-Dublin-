## 📢 Insights & Recommendations  

📌 Best Model:  
   - LSTM showed the highest accuracy and lowest RMSE.

📌 Seasonal Patterns:  
   - Crime tends to rise during weekends and Q3/Q4 annually.

📌 Regional Observations:  
   - Dublin Metropolitan consistently shows high crime frequency.

📌 Model Use Cases:  
   - ARIMA is suitable for simple, seasonal trends.  
   - LSTM is best for complex time dependencies.  
   - Random Forest offers explainability and quick deployment.
